This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Summary of Solution

The idea is to develop a website where customers can easily view the board game library available in-store, for rent and for sale online while also having the ability to perform transactions on the board games.
In addition, extra info on the board games may be provided and to have some user interaction/engagement users may build their own private library of owned board games. The key concepts then should be the board
game as an entity with information on the game and its status (for sale, for rent, in-store), the library of board games for the store which is composed of many board games. In addition, the concept of
transactions that may be performed on board games depending on its status. Lastly the concept of a private library which users may populate based on what games they own to keep track of their collection.
